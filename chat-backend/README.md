Chat with Fiona - Backend

This backend powers the "Chat with Fiona" chatbot on the portfolio site. It has two routes: a health check at `/health` and a chat route at `/chat`. When someone sends a message on the website, the frontend sends the full conversation to `POST /chat` and gets back the AI reply, then shows it in the chat. To run it, create a virtual environment, install the packages in `requirements.txt`, and set the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable. The Gemini API key lives only on the server and is never sent to or stored in the frontend—the website only knows the backend URL.
